# DynamicDiskCloudSoftware
This software is designed to run genomics workflows on the Google Compute Engine. The distinguishing characteristic of this software is that it is designed to automatically mount and unmount disk storage as needed during the course of the workflow. This is in contrast to NFS storage or saving intermediate results to cloud storage and in certain use cases more optimally utilizes resources.
